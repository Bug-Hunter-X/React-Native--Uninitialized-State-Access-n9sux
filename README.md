# React Native: Uninitialized State Access

This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving accessing state variables before they've been initialized, leading to undefined values and potential crashes. It also shows a robust solution using useEffect and conditional rendering. 

## Bug Description:
When a component's state or props are accessed in the render() method before they've had a chance to be set, you encounter unexpected behavior (like undefined values) or runtime errors. This often occurs during initial rendering or when state updates lag behind your component's rendering logic.

## Solution:
The provided solution employs useEffect and conditional rendering to gracefully handle situations where data might not be ready yet.
